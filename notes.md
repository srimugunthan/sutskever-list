This video presents the first five items from a suggested AI reading list, which was compiled in 2020 by Ilya Sutskever, the former Chief Scientist of OpenAI \[[00:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=7)\]. The list consists of approximately 30 papers, blogs, books, and courses \[[00:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=15)\].

### **AI Reading List Items (Part 1)**

The five items discussed primarily focus on foundational concepts and architectures in neural networks, particularly the Transformer and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

1.  **The Annotated Transformer**
    
    *   Presents a simplified version of the seminal "Attention Is All You Need" paper \[[01:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=62)\].
        
    *   Includes a line-by-line implementation of the Transformer architecture \[[01:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=70)\].
        
    *   It is a recommended read for those who want to dive deep into how the Transformer architecture is implemented \[[01:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=76)\].
        
2.  **Blog Post on the First Law of Complexo Dynamics (by Scott Aaronson)**
    
    *   Discusses the so-called "First Law of Complexo Dynamics" \[[01:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=90)\].
        
    *   The law contrasts with the Second Law of Thermodynamics by stating that complexity first **increases** and then **decreases** over time \[[01:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=103)\].
        
    *   This concept is illustrated using a cup of coffee mixed with milk:
        
        *   Separated (low entropy, low complexity) \[[01:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=112)\].
            
        *   Mixing (medium entropy, high complexity) \[[02:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=120)\].
            
        *   Fully mixed (high entropy, low complexity) \[[02:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=126)\].
            
    *   The author attempts to formalize this law using mathematical terms \[[02:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=132)\].
        
3.  **The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks (Blog Post by Andrew Karpathy)**
    
    *   Expresses fascination with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are designed to handle sequential data \[[02:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=162)\].
        
    *   The post explores the inner workings of RNNs, discussing the importance of memory, backpropagation, and how to understand what neurons do while processing input text \[[02:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=170)\].
        
4.  **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks Walkthrough (Blog Post)**
    
    *   Provides a step-by-step walkthrough of LSTMs \[[03:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=189)\].
        
    *   LSTMs are a type of neural network that tries to solve the vanishing gradient problem found in standard Recurrent Neural Networks \[[03:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=196)\].
        
5.  **Recurrent Neural Network Regularization (Paper)**
    
    *   The paper argues that the correct way to apply Dropout in RNNs is to apply it **only to the non-recurrent connections** \[[03:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=224)\].
        
    *   The rationale is to prevent the random erasure of "information from the past" when transitioning from one time step to the next \[[03:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2K0kiHE1Q&t=239)\].
